> Simple upload of Cypress test results to TestRail

Read the blog post [Cypress And TestRail](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/cypress-and-testrail/). For testing, [this is a private TestRail project](https://bahmutov.testrail.io/index.php?/suites/view/1).

## Install

Add this plugin as a dev dependency

```
# If using NPM
$ npm i -D cypress-testrail-simple
# If using Yarn
$ yarn add -D cypress-testrail-simple
```

### Cypress v10+

Include this plugin from your `cypress.config.js` file E2E (or component tests) Node callback

```js
// cypress.config.js
const { defineConfig } = require('cypress')

module.exports = defineConfig({
  e2e: {
    // other settings, like baseUrl
    async setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
      await require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on, config)
    },
  },
})
```

### Cypress before v10

Add the plugin to your Cypress plugin file

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = async (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-testrail-simple
  await require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on, config)
}
```

## Environment variables

When running the Cypress tests on CI, you need to provide the TestRail server variables through the [process (OS) environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable). The following variables should be set:

```
TESTRAIL_HOST=
TESTRAIL_USERNAME=
; the user password or API key for the user
; API key is preferred
TESTRAIL_PASSWORD=
; Note: the project ID is not very sensitive value
TESTRAIL_PROJECTID=
; if you use suites, add a suite ID (with S or without)
TESTRAIL_SUITEID=...
```

If these variables are present, we assume the user wants to use the plugin. You can disable the plugin by passing an argument

```js
module.exports = async (on, config) => {
  // skip loading the plugin
  await require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on, config, true)
}
```

## Bin commands

### testrail-start-run

To start a new TestRail run

```
runId=$(npx testrail-start-run)
```

You can pass an optional test run name and description

```
runId=$(npx testrail-start-run "test run" "test run description")
```

You can redirect the run ID into a file

```
npx testrail-start-run > runId.txt
```

#### Arguments

- `--name` optional name for the test run, alias `-n`
- `--description` optional description for the test run, alias `-d`
- `--suite` optional suite ID, alias `-s`
- `--spec` optional [globby](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globby#readme) pattern for finding specs, extracting case IDs (using the `C\d+` regular expression), and starting a new TestRail run with those case IDs only. Alias `-s`. This option is very useful if only some test cases are automated using Cypress. See the workflow examples in [.github/workflows/cases.yml](./.github/workflows/cases.yml) and [.circleci/config.yml](./.circleci/config.yml).
- `--dry` only parses the arguments and finds the test case IDs, but does not trigger the run
- `--set-gha-output` sets the created TestRail run id as GitHub Actions output `testRailRunId`

```
npx testrail-start-run --name "test run" --description "test run description"
# prints the run id
```

For readability, you can split the command across multiple lines usually

```
npx testrail-start-run \
  --name "test run" \
  --description "test run description" \
  --spec "cypress/e2e/featureA/**.js"
```

#### --find-specs

You can let this utility find the Cypress specs (via [find-cypress-specs](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-cypress-specs)) and extract the test case IDs. Instead of `--spec` parameter, use `--find-specs` flag.

```
npx testrail-start-run \
  --name "test run" \
  --description "test run description" \
  --find-specs
```

#### --tagged

Sometimes you want to pick the tests with a tag to create a new test run. You can use the combination of `--find-specs` and `--tagged tag` to pick only the test case IDs for tests with effective tag "tag"

```
npx testrail-start-run \
  --find-specs --tagged @user
```

You can list several tags, if a test has any one of them, it will be picked.

```js
// example spec file
describe('parent', { tags: '@user' }, () => {
  describe('parent', { tags: '@auth' }, () => {
    it('C50 works a', { tags: '@one' }, () => {})
    it('C51 works b', () => {})
  })
})
describe('outside', { tags: '@new' }, () => {
  it('C101 works c', () => {})
})
```

For example, `--find-specs --tagged @new` will only pick the test "works c" to run with its id `101`. If you want to run the authentication tests, you can call `--find-specs --tagged @auth` and it will pick the case IDs `50` and `51`.

### testrail-run-results

Shows the TestRail run results

```
npx testrail-run-results --run 60
```

Prints a table with test cases

### testrail-close-run

To close an open test run, pass the run ID as an argument or in the file `./runId.txt`

```
# read the run ID from the command line argument
npx testrail-close-run 60
# read the run ID from the file runId.txt
npx testrail-close-run
```

This script allows two explicit parameters:

- `--run <run ID>` to pass the run ID to close
- `--force` to skip checking if the test run has all the tests completed

### testrail-check-case-ids

Prints the list of case IDs for the given TestRail project and optionally verifies them against the IDs found in the Cypress spec files

```text
# just print the list of TestRail cases and titles
$ npx testrail-check-case-ids
# compare the case IDs in the Cypress specs
# against the TestRail project
$ npx testrail-check-case-ids --find-specs
```

When comparing the cases in the spec files against the TestRail project, if there are extra case IDs found in the spec files, the script exits with code 1.

## Testing locally

### Run with all case IDs found from the specs

1. create a new test run

```
as-a . node ./bin/testrail-start-run \
  --name "local test run" \
  --description "test run description" \
  --find-specs
```

Prints the new test run ID, for example `635`

2. Run the tests

```
as-a . npx cypress run --env testRailRunId=635
```

3. Close the TestRail run

```
as-a . node ./bin/testrail-close-run 635
```

### Run with tagged tests

1. create a new test run for tests tagged "@regression"

```
as-a . node ./bin/testrail-start-run \
  --name "local test run for tag @regression" \
  --description "test run description" \
  --find-specs --tagged @regression
```

Prints the new test run ID, for example `662`

2. Run the tests

```
as-a . npx cypress run --env testRailRunId=662
```

3. Close the TestRail run

```
as-a . node ./bin/testrail-close-run 662
```

## Sending test results

During `cypress run` the plugin can send test results for each test case found in the test title using `C\d+` regular expression. To send the results, you need to pass the TestRail run ID. There are several was of doing this:

- pass the run ID as an environment variable `TESTRAIL_RUN_ID`

```
$ TESTRAIL_RUN_ID=635 npx cypress run
```

- pass it via Cypress env value `testRailRunId`

```
$ npx cypress run --env testRailRunId=635
```

- read it from the text file `runId.txt` (written there by the `testrail-start-run` script)

## Print test case information

Use the script "testrail-print-case"

```
$ npx testrail-print-case --case <test case id>
```

## Debugging

This tool uses [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug#readme) to output verbose logs. To see the logs, run it with environment variable `DEBUG=cypress-testrail-simple`.

To start a new test rail run locally and see how the new run is created

```
$ as-a . node ./bin/testrail-start-run.js --spec 'cypress/e2e/\*.js'
```

Make sure this plugin is registered correctly in your `cypress/plugins/index.js` file and the plugin function is declared with the `async` keyword in v3. During the test run, you should see messages like this after each spec

## Why?

Because [cypress-testrail-reporter](https://github.com/Vivify-Ideas/cypress-testrail-reporter) is broken in a variety of ways and does not let me open issues to report the problems.

## Migration

### v1 to v2

The config plugin registration function used to take 2 parameters (it is unclear from the tests)

```js
// v1
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-testrail-simple
  require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on)
}
```

In the second version, we need to pass both the `on` and the `config` parameters

```js
// v2
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-testrail-simple
  require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on, config)
}
```

If you want to skip the plugin's registration step, pass the 3rd argument

```js
// v2
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  const skipPluginRegistration = true
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-testrail-simple
  require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(
    on,
    config,
    skipPluginRegistration,
  )
}
```

### v2 to v3

The plugin registration function has changed from synchronous to `async`. This means _your Cypress plugin file_ also needs to be marked `async` and await the registration.

```js
// v2
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-testrail-simple
  require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on, config)
}
```

Now

```js
// v3
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = async (on, config) => {
  // https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-testrail-simple
  await require('cypress-testrail-simple/src/plugin')(on, config)
}
```
